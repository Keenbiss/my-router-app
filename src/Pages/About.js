      <p>
        I know this is a shoddy attempt but React.js has been choking me. I
        honestly even haven't started yet cos I have to go back to vanilla JS
        and start from the basic. And I have other engagements as I am a working
        M.Sc student. Even the strike gave me no respite cos I was busy with my
        thesis fieldwork. I will catch up but I havent yet hence this is just my
        attempt at the asignment. Please don't be too disappointed for you are
        an awesome tutor and my favourite.
      </p>
    </div>
